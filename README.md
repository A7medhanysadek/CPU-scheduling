# CPU-scheduling
A project that simulates CPU scheduling operations and implements common CPU scheduling algorithms. The project includes operations such as adding two numbers, converting a number to a specific base, and finding the LCM of two numbers.
It also simulates popular CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, RR, PQ, and SJF. The project is implemented in C++ with a visual simulation using WinForms. Custom data structures like queues and priority queues were created from scratch for use within the project.

## 📚 Introduction
This project aims to simulate how the CPU manages tasks using various algorithms. It provides a visual representation of CPU scheduling and the execution of basic operations. The project leverages several CPU scheduling algorithms to manage processes efficiently. Custom data structures, such as queues and priority queues, were designed to be used flexibly throughout the project.

## ✨ Features
- Basic Processes in Assembly:
  - Addition of two numbers ➕: Perform simple addition of two numbers using Assembly code.
  - Number base conversion 🔢: Convert a number from decimal to a specific base (e.g., binary, hexadecimal).
  - Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers 📏: Calculate the LCM of two numbers using Assembly operations.
- CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
  - FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) ⏳: A non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where the process that arrives first is executed first.
  - RR (Round Robin) 🔄: A preemptive scheduling algorithm that assigns each process a fixed time slot in a circular order.
  - PQ (Priority Queue) 🏅: A scheduling algorithm that assigns priority to processes and executes the process with the highest priority first.
  - SJF (Shortest Job First) ⬇️: A non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that executes the process with the shortest burst time first.
  
- Visual Simulation 🖥️: The project uses WinForms for a graphical interface that visually simulates the CPU scheduling algorithms, providing real-time feedback and interaction.
 
- Custom Data Structures 🛠️: Implemented custom data structures such as Queue and Priority Queue to efficiently manage processes and simulate the scheduling algorithms. These data structures were built from scratch to suit the project’s requirements.

## ⚙ Technologies Used
- C++ for core logic implementation
- WinForms for graphical user interface (GUI)
