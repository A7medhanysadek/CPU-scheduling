# CPU-scheduling
A project that simulates CPU scheduling operations and implements common CPU scheduling algorithms. The project includes operations such as adding two numbers, converting a number to a specific base, and finding the LCM of two numbers.
It also simulates popular CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, RR, PQ, and SJF. The project is implemented in C++ with a visual simulation using WinForms. Custom data structures like queues and priority queues were created from scratch for use within the project.

## 📚 Introduction
This project aims to simulate how the CPU manages tasks using various algorithms. It provides a visual representation of CPU scheduling and the execution of basic operations. The project leverages several CPU scheduling algorithms to manage processes efficiently. Custom data structures, such as queues and priority queues, were designed to be used flexibly throughout the project.
